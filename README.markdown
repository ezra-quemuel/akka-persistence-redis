## What is it?

Akka Persistence Redis Plugin is a plugin for [Akka persistence](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/persistence.html) that provides several components:
 - a journal store ;
 - a snapshot store ;
 - a journal query interface implementation.

This plugin stores data in a [redis](https://redis.io) database.

## Installation

The plugin is compiled with Scala 2.12 and 2.11 and are deployed on maven sonatype repositories.
To use the plugin add this to your sbt build file :

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.ezra-quemuel" %% "akka-persistence-redis" % "0.4.1"
```

_Note_: for snapshot versions you will need to add the sonatype snapshot resolver.

## (De)Serialization

The journal and snapshot components save serialized values into the database.
They rely on the [Akka serialization extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/serialization.html).
Custom serialization can be added to handle you data model elements as you wish.

## Using the Journal Component

To use the journal component, you need to enable it in your configuration. To use the default settings, simply add this line:

```scala
akka.persistence.journal.plugin = "akka-persistence-redis.journal"
```

### Tags

The journal component has support for tagged events.
All events wrapped inside an instance of class `akka.persistence.journal.Tagged` are associated to the provided tags in the data store.

## Using the Snapshot Component

To use the snapshot component, you need to enable it in your configuration. To use the default settings, simply add this line:

```scala
akka.persistence.snapshot.plugin = "akka-persistence-redis.snapshot"
```

## Using the Journal Query Interface Component

To use the journal query component, you need to enable it in your configuration. To use the default settings, simply add this line:

```scala
import akka.persistence.query._
import akka.persistence.query.journal.redis._

val readJournal = PersistenceQuery(system)
  .readJournalFor[ScalaReadJournal]("akka-persistence-redis.read-journal")
```

For more details on the available capabilities of the journal query, please refer to the [API documentation](https://safety-data.github.io/akka-persistence-redis/latest/api/akka/persistence/query/journal/redis/ScalaReadJournal.html).

## Database Configuration

This plugin uses [rediscala](https://github.com/Ma27/rediscala) to connect to redis databases and is configured using [Typesafe config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/) library.

Akka persistence redis plugin supports following modes for connecting to Redis:
 - simple
 - sentinel

A default database configuration is used for all components, under the path `akka-persistence-redis.redis`. You may either override this path to apply changes to all components, or override it locally for each component.

See the [reference configuration](src/main/resources/reference.conf) for more details on possible configuration.
